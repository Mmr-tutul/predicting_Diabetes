### Learn step-by-step
In a video that plays in a split-screen with your work area, your instructor will walk you through these steps:

**Task 1:** In this task the Learner will be introduced to the Course Objectives, which is to how to execute a Random Forest Model using R and the Pima Indians data set. There will be a short discussion about the Interface and an Instructor Bio.


**Task 2:** The Learners will get experience looking at the data using ggplot2. This is important in order for the practitioner to see the balance of the data, especially as it relates to the Response Variable.


**Task 3:** The Learner will get experience creating Testing and Training Data Sets. There are multiple ways to do this and the Instructor will go over two of them in this Task.


**Task 4:** The Learner will get experience with the syntax of the Caret, an R package. There will be a discussion on how you can apply hundreds of algorithms to a single problem using the same syntax using Caret as well.


**Task 5:** The Learner will get experience evaluation models in this Task. RMSE will be discussed as well as the Confusion Matrix. The conclusion of the course will use the two evaluation metrics see how well the model performed on the test data set.
